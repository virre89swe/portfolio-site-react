# portfolio-site-react
A small, clean, and mobile-friendly portfolio site. Converted to React in 2020.

It was initially built with jQuery and focused on testing some css-grid technology.
Now it is converted to a React-application which maintains the speed of client-sided rendering
but utilizing modern tech such as the Virtual Dom (in react), React Router(client sided url nav) etc.

A large win of the react-pattern is a much cleaner and maintainable codebase divided into components.

##Todos
* Cleanup the old css a bit more. Move it into separate files for each component and use some base variables.
* Move MODAL into it's own component.
* Convert stateless classes into stateless components rather than keeping them as React.
* Enjoy life
